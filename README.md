# kata_fox_goose_corn_java

This kata is inspired by [fox-goose-bag-of-corn](https://github.com/gigasquid/wonderland-clojure-katas/tree/master/fox-goose-bag-of-corn).

## HOW TO 

```
mvn package
```

```
java -cp target/fox_goose_corn-1.0.jar example.App
```

```
mvn test
```

## Rules

- You must get the **fox**, **goose**, and **bag of corn** safely across the river.
- You can only carry **one item at a time** in the boat.
- The **fox cannot be left alone with the goose** (or it will be eaten).
- The **goose cannot be left alone with the corn** (or it will be eaten).
- The **boat cannot cross the river by itself**; it always carries either you alone or you with one item.
